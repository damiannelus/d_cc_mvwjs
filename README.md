My repo of experiments while doing the Domestika Creative Coding: Making Visuals with JavaScript

Experiments were prepared using the [Canvas-Sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch). To open them please install the canvas-sketch-cli `npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g` and then with your magic wand call something like `canvas-sketch {file name} --open --output=./outputs/{file name w/o extension}` e.g. `canvas-sketch sketch-05.js --open --output=./outputs/sketch-05` . `--output=` part defines the directory in which images will be saved once you press `ctrl/cmd + s`.

Experiments are:

1. "Sketch-01.js" : A simple grid
2. "Sketch-02.js" : My take on a creative clock.
3. "Sketch-03.js" : Colorful flying bubbles with connections between them.
4. "Sketch-04.js" : Creative take on digital noise idea.
5. "Sketch-05.js" : An experiment with fonts and glyphs.

Enjoy 🙋🏼
